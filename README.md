# Unified Intelligence Platform for Startup Incubation
#Alcubator
## Project Overview

The **Unified Intelligence Platform** is a data-driven ERP system designed to manage the entire lifecycle of startups in incubation ecosystems. It unifies fragmented tools into a single platform to streamline:

- Startup onboarding and milestone tracking
- Grant and fund management
- Facility and resource booking
- Mentor and investor engagement
- Analytics and reporting

The platform improves operational efficiency, supports data-driven decisions, and strengthens the startup ecosystem.

## Features

- **Startup Lifecycle Management**: Online applications, milestone tracking, alumni monitoring  
- **Grant & Financial Management**: Grant tracking, disbursement workflows, compliance reporting  
- **Facility & Resource Booking**: Real-time booking, calendar integration, utilization analytics  
- **Mentor & Investor Management**: Profile directories, matching algorithms, interaction logging  
- **Analytics & Reporting**: Dashboards for incubator managers and funding agencies  
- **Communication & Collaboration**: Notifications, messaging, email integration, audit trails  

---

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (SQL)  
- **Frontend**: React.js (Web), React Native (Mobile)  
- **Async Tasks**: Celery + Redis/RabbitMQ  
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSockets  
- **Deployment**: Docker + Kubernetes (Cloud / On-Premise)  
- **Security**: JWT, RBAC, TLS 1.3, AES-256 encryption

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+  
- PostgreSQL 14+  
- Node.js 18+ (frontend)  
- Docker (optional, for containerized setup)  

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/incubator-platform.git
cd incubator-platform
Set up Python virtual environment
```
```bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
Install dependencies
```
```bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure environment variables

Create a .env file in the root directory:

env
Copy code
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/incubator_db
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
DEBUG=True
Run database migrations
```
```bash
Copy code
alembic upgrade head
Start FastAPI backend
```
```bash
Copy code
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
Start frontend
```
```bash
Copy code
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
Deployment Notes
Since the deployment location is flexible, the platform supports:

Cloud Deployment (AWS, GCP, Azure)

Use Docker containers and Kubernetes for scalability

Configure environment variables for production (disable DEBUG)

Use managed PostgreSQL services for reliability

On-Premise Deployment

Install PostgreSQL locally or on private servers

Deploy FastAPI and frontend with Docker or system services

Suitable for incubators requiring data sovereignty

The system is container-ready, so switching deployment platforms in the future is straightforward.
